Pretend Hawaiiâ€™s emergency response system needs revamping. Create a basic interface using CSS/HTML that presents emergency options to an operator who may be either initiating a drill, or sending out a full missile alert. Anything goes. Looking for how you might organize an interface for such a requirement. Bonus: Make it responsive.
